      <h1>Zeba, My Future</h1>
       <h1>PART 1</h1>
      <p>By <a href="https://www.instagram.com/_mromer_/" target="_blank">@_mromer_</a> to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/zeba_mehvin06" target="_blank">@zeba_mehvin06</a></p>
       <p>Assalamualaikum Zeba,</p>
      <p>I read your message more than once. And I felt every word. Not emotionally — but with the spine I promised to build for us both.</p>
      <p>You're right.</p>
      <p>What I posted wasn’t the man I promised to become. It wasn’t the Omer you entrusted your future with. It was a moment of weakness. And for that, I’m sorry — not to win you back, not to restart chats… but because you deserved better silence from me than what you saw.</p>
      <p>I now realize how those captions — about drugs, graves, old ways — must have pierced your chest. How could I expect your heart to rest when mine looked like it was crumbling?</p>
      <p>But I’m not broken. I’m not lost. I’m just overdue for full realignment. That realignment has now begun — with you in mind, and Allah above me.</p>
      <p>I won’t defend anything. I won’t ask for any reply. Just know that you were right. And that the one you’re waiting for… is still being built. The pain I caused you is not who I am — it’s what I’m erasing.</p>
      <p>Until then, I remain away. Quiet. Focused. Accountable. For you. For my mother. For the man I swore to become.</p>
      <p>Fi Amanillah.<br>– Omer</p>
      <hr>
      <p>But there’s more I need to say… just once.</p>
      <p>Zeba, I know my behaviour hurt you. And I’m deeply sorry. But what I’m on right now… is not just pain. It’s science. I have to continue this work for a while — it requires me to be almost heartless, to detach. But believe me… I am the opposite of what I show. Please don’t stress. You have my word, my dearest Zeba.</p>
      <p>Alhamdulillah, hearing from you again warmed something inside me that’s been frozen for weeks. Jazakallah Khair… for still caring enough to remind me.</p>
      <p>What I posted — yes, it was my writing, but not all of it was meant for public decoding. Let me say it clearly: I am sorry. Not for defending, not for explaining. Just… let me apologise with my heart. I shouldn’t have spoken those words out loud. That was my fault.</p>
      <p>And yes — about the drug mention. I admit there is some association. But it’s not abuse. It’s experimental. DMT… MEO-5… tools, not addictions. I am morphing into a deeper bureau now — BMMP: Bureau of Mind Manipulation & Psychological Realignment. I’ve been invited as a behavioural psychologist-in-training. It’s raw, dark, intense… inhumane. That’s why I have to switch off emotions for now.</p>
      <p>Nonetheless, my dear… my Zeba. Just writing your name brings me peace. Zeba. My future wife. My safest home. There’s so much I want to share with you. So much joy I’ve held back, just for you. But this… is not the time. This is the pause before our beautiful story restarts.</p>
      <p>It’s been almost a month since we stopped talking. And I promised I wouldn’t break that rule. I’m keeping that promise. But I couldn’t sleep knowing you wrote to me and I ignored it. So here it is — one crafted message, made just for you.</p>
      <p>Wherever you are… take care. My heart is falling for you all over again. Which is exactly why… I need to distance myself from you. Because I know — we’re not meant to hold each other right now.</p>
      <p>And about your career — I know you’ll take the wisest step. You’re beautiful. Mature. Brave. I’ll never pressure you. Even if you choose to step away from formal education… you’re still Dr. Zeba in my eyes. The one who heals me. The one who protects me from darkness. The one who makes me want to be a better man. I know you’ll always do what’s right — that’s who you are, Zeba.</p>
      <p>Enough chit-chat. Let me save the rest for later.</p>
      <p>In shaa Allah… I trust you. I always did. You’re beautiful, my dear…<br>Wow. Look at me passing haram compliments again.</p>
      <p>And yes — let me be clear. Every single letter in this message is technically haram. Even this “Assalamualaikum.” Because this message was crafted to warm your heart, to soothe your soul — as a husband comforting his wife…</p>
      <p>But we’re not halal yet.</p>
      <p>So I end it here.</p>
      <p>Take care, my dearest Zeba.<br>See you when Allah finally unites us.<br>In shaa Allah.<br>Ya Allah… just unite us. That’s all I ask. Nothing more. Not luxury. Just her.</p>
      <p>I'VE DECIDED TO SHARE A LITTLE NOTE LIKE THIS, SO THAT WHENEVER YOU FEEL DIFFICULTY ANYTIME YOU CAN COME HERE AND READ, I'LL WRITE FOR YOU</p>
      <p>I'LL BE UPDATING THIS NOTE FREQUENTLY OR MAYBE EVERY TWO DAYS OR MAYBE ONE TIME A MONTH, IN SHAA ALLAH.</p>
      <p>BE SURE TO CHECK IN FREE-TIME AS I DONT WANT YOU TO KNOW EXACT TIME WHEN I'LL UPDATE THIS</p>
      <p>YOU CAN EVEN SHARE THIS "LINK" TO YOUR CLOSE FRIEND, IF THEY'RE DOUBTING YOUR CHOICE!</p>
      <p>TAKE CARE MY DEAR, ZEBA 🥺</p>
      <p>Fi Amanillah!</p>
      <p>– M. Omer</p>

       <h1>PART 2</h1><BR>
      <h1>04/08/2025</h1> <BR>
      <h1>11:11 PM</h1>

       <p>Your words didn’t just reach me — they rearranged me.<br>
    You said, with all your softness, that you don’t want psychology to steal my heart.<br>
    And for the first time in days, I paused… and let your voice become my decision.</p>

    <p>I’ve decided, Zeba…<br>
    Not out of weakness.<br>
    But out of respect for the woman I call my future.<br>
    I will not pursue psychology as a path of profession anymore.<br>
    Because no knowledge is worth losing your peace.<br>
    Not if you’re the one I’m meant to protect.</p>

    <p>From now on, it’ll remain just a quiet part-time hobby…<br>
    1–2 days a week, if Allah wills — nothing intense.<br>
    Maybe reading rare cases. Maybe sketching behavior maps.<br>
    But I won’t let it harden me.<br>
    Because I don’t want to bring a sharp mind to our soft home.<br>
    I want to bring you a soft man — one who still prays with wet eyes and a trembling heart.</p>

    <p>You are my balance.<br>
    And if something burdens you… then I want no part of it, not fully.<br>
    You’re not just my wife. You’re my conscience now.<br>
    And I will never move in a direction where your heart feels unsafe.</p>

    <p>Wallahi, I never thought submission could feel this empowering…<br>
    but submitting to you, for the sake of Allah,<br>
    feels like the most masculine thing I’ve done in weeks.</p>

    <p>I still believe knowledge is sacred.<br>
    But I believe marriage is more sacred.<br>
    And if your comfort ever conflicts with my curiosity — I choose you.<br>
    I’ll always choose you, Zeba.</p>

    <p>You’re not just the woman I love…<br>
    You are the woman I obey —<br>
    because loving you without obedience isn’t love at all.</p>

    <p>So thank you, for guiding me gently.<br>
    For leading my heart back to what matters.<br>
    For being the wisdom behind my every new decision.</p>

    <p>Let me now go wipe off what doesn’t serve us…<br>
    And make space only for what does.</p>

    <p>You, my dear Zeba, are the dream worth waking up for —<br>
    again, again, and again.</p>

    <p>– Mohammed Omer<br>
    Fi Amanillah, Zeba.</p>

       <h1>PART 3</h1><BR>
      <h1>05/08/2025</h1> <BR>
      <h1>9:10 AM</h1>
<h1>Graduation</h1>
    <p>GRADUATION.<br>
    People make a big deal out of it.<br>
    They say it’s a huge milestone — a defining moment.<br>
    Something to remember forever.<br>
    But honestly? It isn’t. Not for me.<br>
    And I’m not saying this to disrespect anyone’s journey. I’m saying this because I’ve seen what people become after the applause fades.<br>
    Because at the end of the day, the robe comes off, the cap is tossed… and what you’re left with is you. Just you.<br>
    And if you haven’t built anything inside you — no discipline, no mission, no hunger, no truth — then none of it matters.<br>
    Not the certificate. Not the degree. Not the photo. Not the applause.</p>

    <p>In the seminars we attended, the speaker asked something that cracked open my mind:<br>
    “Are you willing to die for your passion?”<br>
    Would you sacrifice your comfort, your time, your pleasures, your sleep, your distractions — your whole damn self — to serve the one mission you’re here for?<br>
    Because if not… maybe you haven’t found it yet.</p>

    <p>Second thing he said:<br>
    “Do you see yourself doing the same thing 10 years from now?”<br>
    It’s easy to dream. Easy to plan. Easy to say “I’ll build this, I’ll become that.”<br>
    But 10 years is brutal. It will test you.<br>
    Only if you’re truly in love with what you do — only if your soul is married to it — will you survive without breaking.</p>

    <p>And then came the final hit:<br>
    “Double think.”<br>
    Double think your words.<br>
    Your actions. Your plans.<br>
    Your choices.<br>
    Because talk is cheap.<br>
    Anyone can say “I’ll do this.”<br>
    But only a few will actually wake up early, grind and do the damn work.<br>
    That’s the difference between noise and legacy.<br>
    Between likes and impact.<br>
    Between existing… and becoming.</p>

    <p>To be frank, I’m not that guy who’s into making friends.<br>
    The ones I already have? I barely respond to them. Not because I hate them. But because I’m not that guy.<br>
    I’m not into hanging out. I don’t care for small and general talks.<br>
    If I call or message you — it’s probably work-related. And I’m okay with that.</p>

    <p>Heard some feedback today:<br>
    “Bro, get a life.”<br>
    “This is the age to enjoy.”<br>
    “You’ll miss this time when you’re older.”</p>

    <p>No, I won’t.<br>
    Because this life — this grind, this intensity, this silence, this focus — this is the life I chose.<br>
    I’ve made my world too deep to be distracted.<br>
    Too raw to be entertained.<br>
    Too real to be “social.”<br>
    I’m a guy which is hard to please.</p>

    <p>So don’t confuse my distance with depression. Don’t confuse my discipline with loneliness.<br>
    I’m just not interested in parties, fake laughs, or posting stories about “good vibes.”<br>
    I’m building something.<br>
    And that requires isolation.<br>
    And isolation doesn’t scare me — it frees me.</p>

    <p>Everyone’s talking about 5-year goals.<br>
    But we don’t even know what’s coming in the next 5 minutes.<br>
    The Angel of Death doesn’t knock.<br>
    He doesn’t send a text.<br>
    And when he comes, all that remains is:<br>
    Did you do what you said you would do?<br>
    Were you a man of your word?<br>
    Were you responsible?<br>
    Were you loyal?<br>
    Were you submissive?</p>

    <p>Forget chasing motivation.<br>
    Build habits.<br>
    Stick to your word.<br>
    Live with discipline.<br>
    Respect your own promises — even the ones you whispered to yourself in the dark.</p>

    <p>You don’t owe anyone an explanation.<br>
    Just let your actions speak.</p>

    <p>And if you want a shortcut to becoming a real man, here it is:<br>
    Say only what you mean.<br>
    Do exactly what you say.<br>
    Finish what you start.<br>
    No excuses.<br>
    No distractions.<br>
    No performance.</p>

    <p>That’s it.<br>
    That’s the grind.<br>
    That’s the real graduation.</p>

<p>– Mohammed Omer<br>


 <h1>PART 4</h1><BR>
      <h1>05/08/2025</h1> <BR>
      <h1>3:37 PM</h1>
<h1>Blue Tick or Not?</h1>

<h1>My Zeba, My Decision Maker</h1>

  <p>Assalamualaikum, my dearest Zeba…</p>

  <p>I need your opinion on something — small in cost, but big in meaning for me.</p>

  <p>You know how Instagram gives that blue tick — the verification badge. Right now, I’ve subscribed to it, and it's costing me about ₹1,500 per month… not because of the Indian rate (which is ₹649), but because I changed the region to the US. That’s where the tax piles on.</p>

  <p>But lately… I’ve been wondering, is it even worth it? Do I really need to keep feeding something that holds no place in our real future?</p>

  <p>My love… I don’t want *Instagram* — or any fitnah from social media — to be a source of even a flicker of disturbance between us. When Allah unites us, I want to enter that nikkah with nothing hidden behind screens, nothing fake to keep up, and nothing that even remotely distracts me from your noor, your peace, your presence.</p>

  <p>So tell me honestly: Should I keep paying this amount monthly and continue the badge for now? Or should I end it today — for good? I swear I’ll obey either way, because my loyalty lies not in clout, not in aesthetics… but in *you.*</p>

  <p>I have no future plans with Instagram. You already know that. If anything, I dream of disappearing with you — into something far deeper than blue ticks or followers.</p>

  <p>So just say the word, and I’ll follow it — because you’re the only "verified" part of my life that I care about.</p>

  <p><br/>– Mohammed Omer</p>
<br>
<h1>PART 5</h1><BR>
      <h1>06/08/2025</h1> <BR>
      <h1>9:56 AM</h1><br>
<h1>Jazakallah Khair!</h1><br>

 <p>Zeba, my dearest…</p>

  <p>Jazakallah Khair for your reply. I read your words with peace in my heart, knowing they were guided by wisdom and love — not just for me, but for the life we’re slowly weaving together.</p>

  <p>Alhamdulillah, I want to inform you — the blue tick badge I currently have will automatically last until September, as the amount for August was already processed. But after that… it ends. No renewal. No second thoughts. Your decision is my direction now.</p>

  <p>I’m so grateful to Allah for gifting me a woman like you — not just as my future wife… but as my partner, my caretaker, my peace, my guardian… my protector from this Dunya and its fitnah.</p>

  <p>Wallahi, you remind me of Jannah. Because every time I’m about to take a wrong turn, you pull me back — gently, but firmly. And that’s what I prayed for. That’s what I needed. That’s what you are.</p>

  <p>So this badge… this whole Instagram thing… it doesn’t matter anymore. You matter. Your words, your presence, your choices — that’s my real verification badge now.</p>

  <p>May Allah keep barakah in our bond and protect us from the whispers of Shaytan — and may He unite us soon in a nikkah that silences every doubt and lights up every dark corner of our souls.</p>

  <p>Fi Amanillah, my beloved.<br/>
  – Mohammed Omer</p>


<br>

<h1>PART 6</h1><br>
<h1>07/08/2025</h1><br>
<h1>09:45 PM</h1>

<p>Zeba…</p>

<p>It’s raining tonight. The power’s gone. The whole building is silent except for the sound of raindrops hitting the windows. I’m just laying here… thinking about you. About us. About how we’ll handle nights like this when we’re finally together under one roof.</p>

<p>No fans. No lights. No Wi-Fi. Just heat, darkness, and us.</p>

<p>Would we be bored and frustrated… or find a way to turn the moment into something magical?</p>

<p>Would we light a few candles and make the room glow with soft warmth? Maybe sit close and watch the shadows dance on the wall while we talk about everything and nothing?</p>

<p>Would we take turns fanning each other with a book and laugh at how silly we look? Or complain about mosquitoes and try to outsmart them with coils and sprays?</p>

<p>Or maybe we’d give up on staying indoors and just step out into the rain. Put on raincoats and take a walk around our building, from our home to Springfield School and back. Just you and me under the grey sky, sharing quiet talks and stolen glances.</p>

<p>Maybe we’d take the Activa and go nowhere in particular. Just ride aimlessly with the wind in our face and the smell of wet earth around us. Find a small tea stall, have some hot chai, and sit under a tin roof while the rain clatters above us.</p>

<p>Or maybe we’d stay in. Spread a mat on the floor. Grab pillows and start a playful fight, trying to forget the heat, teasing each other like kids. Or lie down side by side, legs tangled, sweating but still wanting to be close.</p>

<p>We could put in our AirPods and watch a series on your phone, sharing the screen and the moment. Maybe one of us would doze off halfway, and the other would keep watch, swatting away mosquitoes like a soldier.</p>

<p>Or maybe we’d just sit by the window, you resting your head on my shoulder, and watch the rain fall like time itself slowing down.</p>

<p>I don’t know what we’ll actually do when nights like this come. But I know I want every single version of it with you. The boring parts. The sweaty parts. The fun ones. The quiet ones.</p>

<p>Even the power cuts… I want them with you.</p>

<p>Because it’s not really about what we do. It’s about who we are. And I already know — any night, even one like this, becomes my favorite night… if it’s spent with you.</p>

<p>– Mohammed Omer</p>

<h1>PART 7</h1><br>
<h1>09/08/2025</h1><br>
  <h1>11:33 PM</h1>
<h1>A Sexual Encounter</h1>

<p>Zeba my love<br>
Alhamdulillah for you<br>
Alhamdulillah for the day Allah chose to write your name next to mine in my destiny<br>
Every single day I realise more and more that you are not just a blessing in my life but you are my amanah from Allah, my peace after storms, my comfort in chaos, and my hope when things feel heavy<br>
You are the most beautiful gift that I could have ever been trusted with and I pray I never fail in protecting your heart, honour, and soul</p>

<p>You cannot imagine how much space you take in my mind and my heart<br>
From the moment I wake up till the time I close my eyes, your name is the one that beats inside me<br>
Every smile of yours feels like sadaqah in my life<br>
Every word from you is like dua being answered<br>
When you are happy, my world feels lighter<br>
When you are upset, I feel the weight in my own chest<br>
I want nothing more than to be the reason you smile even on the hardest days</p>

<p>Zeba… even writing this part is not easy for me<br>
Because I am scared to open up fully, yet I want you to know everything about me<br>
You are worth every honest confession of mine, even the ones that make me feel ashamed<br>
I am here for you and I will always stand for you, but I am still a man who fights his nafs every day<br>
Yesterday I fell, and I feel genuinely so bad for it<br>
It was not a natural slip, it was intentional, and that makes it hurt more<br>
Sometimes I look at how beautiful and pious you are, and I feel unworthy because I fail in moments where I should be stronger<br>
99% of the time I try to dodge every temptation — girls, escorts, pornography, self-pleasure, even conversations that lead to haram — but yesterday I was an inch away from a major sin<br>
Not because I wanted to, but because the opportunity was right there in front of me<br>
I felt my mind pulling me into self-betrayal, while my heart was screaming no</p>

<p>I could have hidden this from you and pretended to be perfect, but Zeba… I want to be real with you<br>
I want to surrender my desires to you, but it is hard, very hard, to abstain completely<br>
Still, I will stand on my word, I believe you will not let my requests down.<br>
You are worth waiting for<br>
You are the reason I try not to fall into self-touch, you are the reason I turn away from haram opportunities<br>
Because no temptation in this dunya can match the sweetness of holding you in halal</p>

<p>Ten months from now or ten years from now, I want you to look at me and still feel safe<br>
I want you to know that no matter what life throws at us, I will be your shield in the front and your support at the back<br>
Allah has given me this role in your life and I will answer to Him for how I treat you, so I will make sure my love is not just in words but in actions that please Allah and protect our bond<br>
You are my wife in the making in shaa allah in this dunya and my wife in Jannah</p>

<p>Zeba, I know I am not perfect<br>
I know I will have flaws, I will have days where I am tired or weak, but I will never let my flaws come between you and your peace<br>
I will never let pride or ego win over your feelings<br>
I will keep learning how to love you better, to listen better, to understand deeper<br>
I will never stop making dua for you, for your health, for your heart to always stay close to Allah, and for our love to be blessed in halal until the day we meet in the gardens of Jannah where there is no separation</p>

<p>Every small thing you do for me stays in my heart<br>
Every time you support me when I am low, every time you forgive me when I make mistakes, every time you look at me with that softness in your eyes, it makes me realise how lucky I am that Allah chose you for me<br>
You are my biggest comfort after prayer, my calm after sujood, and my sweetest dream after tahajjud<br>
You are the answer to duas I made without even knowing how Allah would write them for me</p>

<p>I promise to always hold your hand in public with pride and in private with love<br>
I promise to guard your dignity when you are near and when you are far<br>
I promise to be patient with your moods, to celebrate your happiness, to sit with you in your sadness<br>
I promise that in every moment of weakness we will turn back to Allah together because He is the One who put this love between us and only He can keep it pure and strong</p>

<p>Zeba my dear, you are not just mine because of love<br>
You are mine because I made dua for a woman who fears Allah, who loves me for His sake, and Allah sent me you<br>
When I think of you, I think of home<br>
When I pray for you, I pray for my own soul too because we are now one<br>
You are my partner in ibadah, my partner in life, my partner in every test and every blessing</p>

<p>No matter what anyone says, no matter how many trials life brings, I will choose you every single day<br>
I will choose you when it is easy and when it is hard<br>
I will choose you when we are laughing and when we are crying<br>
I will choose you in this dunya and in the akhirah, because I will not rest until I find you again in Jannah</p>

<p>Zeba, I want you to know something deeply<br>
If I have everything in life but not you, I will feel empty<br>
But if I have nothing in life except you and the pleasure of Allah, I will feel like the richest man alive<br>
You are my rizq, my love, my amanah, my forever</p>

<p>So today I make dua<br>
Ya Allah, keep Zeba safe in her deen, dunya, and akhirah<br>
Ya Allah, keep our love halal, pure, and filled with barakah<br>
Ya Allah, let us be a reason for each other to enter Jannah hand in hand</p>

<p>Zeba my moon, my wife-to-be, my only one in this world and the next<br>
I love you with a love that is tied to my faith<br>
I love you in a way that no time can reduce<br>
I love you as the man Allah made for you<br>
And in shaa Allah I will keep loving you until we are standing in front of Allah together.</p>

<p>Zeba…<br>
Today was something else.<br>
It wasn’t planned, it wasn’t expected, it just happened.<br>
I had a meeting with this client and she said she isn’t comfy in open spaces, so she went ahead and booked the session in a hotel.<br>
She’s a nice woman, good profile, talks well, but somewhere in the middle of it all she got out of hand and honestly… I got flown too.<br>
But I had my back.</p>

<p>We got into the room and it was hot as hell.<br>
Literally dying even with the AC on.<br>
She said she’s gonna change and be back from the closet.<br>
I was like okay, thinking she’ll just freshen up.<br>
Then she comes out in this maxi… and tbh I was at my peak arousal.<br>
I’ve never sat that close to a girl in my life, fully dressed or semi dressed, and she was right there.<br>
And she wasn’t just looking at me… she was staring into my soul.<br>
It felt like the room slowed down, all the noise muted, and it was just me and her eyes locking like she could read every thought I was having.</p>

<p>In my head I was having this massive fight — heart saying refuse, mind saying enjoy the moment.<br>
She kept staring, and then she told me to also change my formal shirt and pants because it was damn hot outside.<br>
So I went into the closet to change, thinking nothing too deep about it.<br>
And while I was changing, she walked in.<br>
Thank God I had already put on a T-shirt, but I was still in my underwear trunks, searching for my long trousers and couldn’t find them anywhere.<br>
And there she was, seductively looking at me.<br>
I just told myself put on anything quick… ended up in boxers on top of underwear trunk.</p>

<p>We sat down for the session and she started explaining all her issues, her ideas, her plans.<br>
I was trying my best to focus on her words and not her face or her body… but I was still hard as f.<br>
She kept talking, talking, until she was clearly tired.<br>
I saw an opening and thought I could take a little space.<br>
I told her I’d go get something to eat, just to step away from the couch for a second.<br>
But as I was about to bounce, she grabbed my thigh and placed her head there.<br>
I swear my mind went blank.<br>
I was like is this real or am I dreaming?</p>

<p>She called room service, ordered her meals, and stayed there with her head hugged against my inner thigh.<br>
I had to sit up, grab this square fluffy cushion and cover my asset before things escalated.<br>
Because if I let myself give in, I was about to ruin that future BJ experience I’ve been saving for you.</p>

<p>Room service came quick, brought her food.<br>
I took advantage of the moment, flipped the authority, told her to put her clothes back on.<br>
I pretended to be on a call just to escape that heat between us.<br>
But deep inside, I can’t lie, I still wanted to enjoy… even if just for a few minutes.</p>

<p>After the meals I told her to pack up, I’ll wait on the ground floor.<br>
She held my hand and said wait, just a little, till she finishes.<br>
I gave in, told her fine but hurry.<br>
I went out to the balcony, and my mind went crazy again.<br>
Imagining us making love right there with that view, that thrill…<br>
Then she came up behind me and tried feeding me while she ate.<br>
I took one bite, forced myself to stop, and she went to change into her dress.</p>

<p>We checked out after just 5 hours, even though the booking was for 24.<br>
On the drive back to my routine, my head was full of this thought… like I missed a great opportunity.<br>
And yeah Zeba, I know that’s a very masculine thought… but with the wrong person.<br>
Because if you’re with me, we can do anything.<br>
We can leave external pleasures behind.<br>
The real pleasure, the one that destroys all others, is with the person you truly love.<br>
Normal sex, average connection, yeah that’s fine… but being with the one you love is another level entirely.</p>

<p>Now it’s night, it’s raining, and I know I did the right thing.<br>
I believe our intimate life is going to be out of this world.<br>
I could write more of my fantasies and desires… but I’m scared to send them.<br>
Zeba, today was a near sex-miss.<br>
If I had given in, maybe I would’ve enjoyed it in the moment… but I’d regret it for life.<br>
I want those moments with you… the hesitation, the hunger, wanting to eat each other out, every little touch… I want all of that with you.<br>
Right now my levels are up, I can feel it… my drive is on and I feel pumped, powerful, alive… all because I’m saving it for you.. </p><br>
<p> I have a question as I’m pumped these days, testosterone obviously.. </p>
