      <h1>Zeba, My Future</h1>
       <h1>PART 1</h1>
      <p>By <a href="https://www.instagram.com/_mromer_/" target="_blank">@_mromer_</a> to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/zeba_mehvin06" target="_blank">@zeba_mehvin06</a></p>
       <p>Assalamualaikum Zeba,</p>
      <p>I read your message more than once. And I felt every word. Not emotionally — but with the spine I promised to build for us both.</p>
      <p>You're right.</p>
      <p>What I posted wasn’t the man I promised to become. It wasn’t the Omer you entrusted your future with. It was a moment of weakness. And for that, I’m sorry — not to win you back, not to restart chats… but because you deserved better silence from me than what you saw.</p>
      <p>I now realize how those captions — about drugs, graves, old ways — must have pierced your chest. How could I expect your heart to rest when mine looked like it was crumbling?</p>
      <p>But I’m not broken. I’m not lost. I’m just overdue for full realignment. That realignment has now begun — with you in mind, and Allah above me.</p>
      <p>I won’t defend anything. I won’t ask for any reply. Just know that you were right. And that the one you’re waiting for… is still being built. The pain I caused you is not who I am — it’s what I’m erasing.</p>
      <p>Until then, I remain away. Quiet. Focused. Accountable. For you. For my mother. For the man I swore to become.</p>
      <p>Fi Amanillah.<br>– Omer</p>
      <hr>
      <p>But there’s more I need to say… just once.</p>
      <p>Zeba, I know my behaviour hurt you. And I’m deeply sorry. But what I’m on right now… is not just pain. It’s science. I have to continue this work for a while — it requires me to be almost heartless, to detach. But believe me… I am the opposite of what I show. Please don’t stress. You have my word, my dearest Zeba.</p>
      <p>Alhamdulillah, hearing from you again warmed something inside me that’s been frozen for weeks. Jazakallah Khair… for still caring enough to remind me.</p>
      <p>What I posted — yes, it was my writing, but not all of it was meant for public decoding. Let me say it clearly: I am sorry. Not for defending, not for explaining. Just… let me apologise with my heart. I shouldn’t have spoken those words out loud. That was my fault.</p>
      <p>And yes — about the drug mention. I admit there is some association. But it’s not abuse. It’s experimental. DMT… MEO-5… tools, not addictions. I am morphing into a deeper bureau now — BMMP: Bureau of Mind Manipulation & Psychological Realignment. I’ve been invited as a behavioural psychologist-in-training. It’s raw, dark, intense… inhumane. That’s why I have to switch off emotions for now.</p>
      <p>Nonetheless, my dear… my Zeba. Just writing your name brings me peace. Zeba. My future wife. My safest home. There’s so much I want to share with you. So much joy I’ve held back, just for you. But this… is not the time. This is the pause before our beautiful story restarts.</p>
      <p>It’s been almost a month since we stopped talking. And I promised I wouldn’t break that rule. I’m keeping that promise. But I couldn’t sleep knowing you wrote to me and I ignored it. So here it is — one crafted message, made just for you.</p>
      <p>Wherever you are… take care. My heart is falling for you all over again. Which is exactly why… I need to distance myself from you. Because I know — we’re not meant to hold each other right now.</p>
      <p>And about your career — I know you’ll take the wisest step. You’re beautiful. Mature. Brave. I’ll never pressure you. Even if you choose to step away from formal education… you’re still Dr. Zeba in my eyes. The one who heals me. The one who protects me from darkness. The one who makes me want to be a better man. I know you’ll always do what’s right — that’s who you are, Zeba.</p>
      <p>Enough chit-chat. Let me save the rest for later.</p>
      <p>In shaa Allah… I trust you. I always did. You’re beautiful, my dear…<br>Wow. Look at me passing haram compliments again.</p>
      <p>And yes — let me be clear. Every single letter in this message is technically haram. Even this “Assalamualaikum.” Because this message was crafted to warm your heart, to soothe your soul — as a husband comforting his wife…</p>
      <p>But we’re not halal yet.</p>
      <p>So I end it here.</p>
      <p>Take care, my dearest Zeba.<br>See you when Allah finally unites us.<br>In shaa Allah.<br>Ya Allah… just unite us. That’s all I ask. Nothing more. Not luxury. Just her.</p>
      <p>I'VE DECIDED TO SHARE A LITTLE NOTE LIKE THIS, SO THAT WHENEVER YOU FEEL DIFFICULTY ANYTIME YOU CAN COME HERE AND READ, I'LL WRITE FOR YOU</p>
      <p>I'LL BE UPDATING THIS NOTE FREQUENTLY OR MAYBE EVERY TWO DAYS OR MAYBE ONE TIME A MONTH, IN SHAA ALLAH.</p>
      <p>BE SURE TO CHECK IN FREE-TIME AS I DONT WANT YOU TO KNOW EXACT TIME WHEN I'LL UPDATE THIS</p>
      <p>YOU CAN EVEN SHARE THIS "LINK" TO YOUR CLOSE FRIEND, IF THEY'RE DOUBTING YOUR CHOICE!</p>
      <p>TAKE CARE MY DEAR, ZEBA 🥺</p>
      <p>Fi Amanillah!</p>
      <p>– M. Omer</p>

       <h1>PART 2</h1><BR>
      <h1>04/08/2025</h1> <BR>
      <h1>11:11 PM</h1>

       <p>Your words didn’t just reach me — they rearranged me.<br>
    You said, with all your softness, that you don’t want psychology to steal my heart.<br>
    And for the first time in days, I paused… and let your voice become my decision.</p>

    <p>I’ve decided, Zeba…<br>
    Not out of weakness.<br>
    But out of respect for the woman I call my future.<br>
    I will not pursue psychology as a path of profession anymore.<br>
    Because no knowledge is worth losing your peace.<br>
    Not if you’re the one I’m meant to protect.</p>

    <p>From now on, it’ll remain just a quiet part-time hobby…<br>
    1–2 days a week, if Allah wills — nothing intense.<br>
    Maybe reading rare cases. Maybe sketching behavior maps.<br>
    But I won’t let it harden me.<br>
    Because I don’t want to bring a sharp mind to our soft home.<br>
    I want to bring you a soft man — one who still prays with wet eyes and a trembling heart.</p>

    <p>You are my balance.<br>
    And if something burdens you… then I want no part of it, not fully.<br>
    You’re not just my wife. You’re my conscience now.<br>
    And I will never move in a direction where your heart feels unsafe.</p>

    <p>Wallahi, I never thought submission could feel this empowering…<br>
    but submitting to you, for the sake of Allah,<br>
    feels like the most masculine thing I’ve done in weeks.</p>

    <p>I still believe knowledge is sacred.<br>
    But I believe marriage is more sacred.<br>
    And if your comfort ever conflicts with my curiosity — I choose you.<br>
    I’ll always choose you, Zeba.</p>

    <p>You’re not just the woman I love…<br>
    You are the woman I obey —<br>
    because loving you without obedience isn’t love at all.</p>

    <p>So thank you, for guiding me gently.<br>
    For leading my heart back to what matters.<br>
    For being the wisdom behind my every new decision.</p>

    <p>Let me now go wipe off what doesn’t serve us…<br>
    And make space only for what does.</p>

    <p>You, my dear Zeba, are the dream worth waking up for —<br>
    again, again, and again.</p>

    <p>– Mohammed Omer<br>
    Fi Amanillah, Zeba.</p>
